# Portfolio
##My own custom designed portfolio site to show my work

I decided to build my own website from the ground up over using a template so that I could have complete control over every detail of my site and deepend my web design skills.

## Features

  -Projects are neatly organized into their own sections.
  
  -All data for each project is kept in a PostgresSQL database that has been seeded from the terminal.
  
## To run locally

  -run postgres and createdb 'portfolio' in a terminal window

  -npm install
  
  -node seed.js
  
  -npm start
  
  -visit http://localhost:3000/
